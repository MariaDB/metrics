# GITDM

* Move some of the people in the employers list to the aliases list where possible (particularly MariaDB Corporation / Foundation staff).
* Using `-t` crashes.
* Add breakdown by area of codebase (individual engines).
* Separate out individual contributors that contribute on behalf of OSes into another list (I think GroupMap might be useful here).

# PRs

* Allow script to accept custom date range inputs (week/month/year and start/stop).
* Create generic custom plot function.
