# GITDM

* Have the git retrieval code smart enough to do `pull --ff-only` if the local clone already exists.
* Move some of the people in the employers list to the aliases list where possible (particularly MariaDB Corporation / Foundation staff).
* Modify the shell script to be more flexible with regards to date ranges.
* Generate CSV file outputs.
* Using `-t` crashes.
* Possibly change "Funky" output. Or at least add aliases for the funky entries.
* Drop stats not relevant to us from output.
* Fix cause of this message: `Skip big patch (2491788)`.
* Add breakdown by area of codebase (individual engines).
* Separate out individual contributors that contribute on behalf of OSes into another list (I think GroupMap might be useful here).

# PRs

* Allow script to accept custom date range inputs (week/month/year and start/stop).
* Create generic custom plot function.
