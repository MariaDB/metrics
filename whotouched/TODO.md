# TODO

* Git repo update / retrieve
* Code comment / documentation
* Accelerate get_commit_lines_for_file() by allowing multiple files
* Handle submodules we care about (all are skipped for now)
* Initial commit skipped in get_commit_lines_for_file()
* Execute each section of the config in a different threads/processes
* Look into pygit2.Tree.__contains__ for potential optimisation
